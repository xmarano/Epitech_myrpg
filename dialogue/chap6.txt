//Chapitre 6//

*Spawn at the throne room*

1: This throne room… there’s a malevolent aura emanating from the throne. 
3: Something’s not right here. Can you feel it? It’s coming from the throne. 
2: We need to hurry. There’s an evil presence around the throne. 
4: The throne… it’s radiating a wicked energy. We must act quickly. 
0: The throne is the source of this dark aura. We need to move fast.

*Encounter the boss*

Boss6: So, you’ve made it this far. But you will go no further!

1: We’ve come for the king. If you stand in our way, we will fight. 
3: We’re not afraid of you, old man. We’ve faced your kind before. 
2: We’re prepared to do whatever it takes. We won’t be stopped here. 
4: You might be strong, but we’ve got something you don’t - determination. 
0: We’re here for the king. And we won’t let you or anyone else stop us.

Boss6: You’re brave, I’ll give you that. But bravery alone won’t save you.

1: We’ve got more than bravery on our side. We’ve got each other. 
3: And we’ve got a reason to fight. That’s more than you can say. 
2: We’re not just fighting for ourselves. We’re fighting for everyone you’ve threatened. 
4: And we won’t back down. Not now, not ever. 
0: So come on then. Let’s see what you’ve got.

*Fight part*

Boss6: How… how did you defeat me?

1: Tell us where to find the king. Now. 
3: We’ve won. Now, where is the king? 
2: We’re not leaving until you tell us where the king is. 
4: You’ve lost. Now, where’s the king? 
0: We’ve beaten you. Now tell us where to find the king.

Boss6: Underneath this throne… there’s a path… to the king’s village… a frozen kingdom…


1: We need to move. The king’s village awaits. 
3: A frozen kingdom… Let’s go. 
2: We’ve got no time to waste. To the king’s village. 
4: A frozen kingdom… Sounds interesting. Let’s go. 
0: The king’s village… Let’s move out.
