*Dialogue with a villager*

Villager: Who are you? We haven’t seen strangers in a long time.

3: And we’ve heard about your king. We need to meet him. 
2: Our journey is urgent, and time is against us.

*Arrival at the castle*

Boss5: Halt! Who dares to approach the 0al grounds without permission?!

1: We mean no harm. We seek an audience with the king.
3: We’ve traveled far and faced many dangers. We won’t be stopped now.
2: We have proven our worth time and again. Let us pass.
4: Your king needs to hear what we have to say.

Boss5: None shall pass without proving their worth! Prepare yourselves!

After a fierce battle, the 0al Guard is defeated

Boss5: You… you’ve proven your strength. The king… he resides in secrecy.
There’s a hidden path behind the throne room. Now leave me be!

1: Thank you for your guidance; we shall proceed with caution.
3: Every step brings us closer to unraveling this mystery.
2: May our paths cross again under friendlier skies.
4: Your strength is admirable; may peace find you.
0: In another life, we could have been allies.
